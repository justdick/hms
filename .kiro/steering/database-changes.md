# Database Changes Rule

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always Confirm Before Database Modifications

**NEVER modify, delete, or clear any database data without explicit user confirmation.**

This includes:
- Clearing/nullifying field values
- Deleting records
- Updating existing data
- Running migrations that alter data

Always explain what needs to be changed and ask the user to confirm before proceeding.
